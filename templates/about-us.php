        <div class="bigp">

          <p>Our innovative spirit, creativity and willingness to think outside the box motivate everything we do. Sophisticated wood materials and compact laminates are our strength. Fundermax is much more than a sustainable production company:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>We see ourselves as a service partner who supports all our customers throughout the entire decision-making process and beyond.</li>
            <li>We also see ourselves as a design laboratory in which developments are driven forward and innovations are created.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Proud of our team: We are particularly proud of our employees, who are already actively shaping the design and product trends of tomorrow, right down to the materials made from renewable raw materials. After all, Fundermax stands for sustainability! When it comes to energy generation, we also think outside the company and generate green electricity and district heating to an extent that significantly exceeds our own needs.</p>

        <h2 class="mega-title mb-4">Focus on the people</h2>
        <div class="bigp">

          <p>We at Fundermax work together on an equal footing, because we know: together we are strong and can develop optimal solutions for the future! We are all united by our common values, above all <strong>trust, honesty and transparency</strong>. Another important factor for maintaining a good working atmosphere is laughing together and celebrating our success.</p>

          <p>At Fundermax, we also place great importance to retaining our employees in the long term. That is why we not only offer a safe working environment, but also numerous <strong>learning and development opportunities</strong>.</p>

          <p><strong>Feedforward instead of feedback:</strong> This is ensured on the one hand with regular internal company surveys, and the other hand with an open ear. At Fundermax, we welcome and act on the suggestions and ideas from our employees. The feedback serves as an impetus for future measures. <strong>The result:</strong> The entire team is motivated to work proactively on the further development of Fundermax and is happy about the success we achieve together.</p>
